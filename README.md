# 1595 Scouting app

## What is this?
This is the scouting app used by FRC team 1595. Its written in Java and has been updated for the 2018 FRC game: FIRST Power Up. 

In order to use the app, you will need the [Scouting app server](https://github.com/1595Dragons/Scouting-app-server) in order to pair and receive the data taken by this app.

## Recommended action after installing
After installing the app, it is recommended that you pair the device with the other device that you are intending to run the [receiver](https://github.com/1595Dragons/Scouting-app-server) on. From there, you can enter the MAC address of the receiver into the app, and you should be good to go!
